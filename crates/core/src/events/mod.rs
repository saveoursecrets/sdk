//! Events represent changes to accounts, folders and files.
//!
//! Events may be appended to *event log* files for persistence.
//!
//! Event logs maintain an in-memory merkle tree of commits to
//! enable syncing of data between devices.
//!
//! They are also used for some read events to maintain
//! an audit trail of actions.
